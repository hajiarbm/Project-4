Nothing more than Anaconda is needed. The code is written in Python3.

Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in the students distribution in US states based on race to answer these questions:

Based on the type of the public school, draw a graph that shows the percentage of students with different races 

Which states have fewer White students compared to at least one of the other racial groups?

List the top 5 states with the highest populations of White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and other racial groups.

File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook with the code related to answer the above questions. The code is commented.

Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/tableGenerator.aspx?savedTableID=649127
