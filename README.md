# Project-4
This work is based on 2022-23 Public School Student Enrollments by Race/Ethnicity dataset.

The file consists of three parts:

1) Data Preparation
2) Data Cleaning
3) Data Mining
   
Three main questions were answered:
1) Based on the type of the public school, draw a graph that shows the percentage of students with different races
2) What are the states that the amount of white students are less than at least one of the other races?
3) List the top five states with most white, hispanic, black and asian, ... students?
